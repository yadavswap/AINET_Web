                                AINET Connect project was launched with an aim to consolidate the reach and impact of the TA
                                (AINET Association of English Teachers) by building stronger and more sustainably managed
                                channels of communication, especially on social media platforms. AINET was lagging behind in
                                productive use of these channels before the start of the project. This project has opened up new
                                opportunities and also challenges for the TA. More than halfway through, we can say we were able
                                to achieve a significant part of our project objectives.

            <h4>Present Status of the Project </h4><br>
            <p align=" justify">
                    AINET has put together a team of volunteer teachers, called AINET Connect Associates, creating an
                    impactful presence for AINET on various social media platforms by reaching out to geographically
                    scattered and vast ELT community with diverse professional development activities. The project
                    team and 14 AINET Connect Associates, all volunteer teacher-members of AINET, supported by the
                    AINET executive members and the partners, have been designing, delivering, and monitoring
                    initiatives and activities on social media platforms. We started with Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp
                    and YouTube and have subsequently added Pinterest, Telegram and Instagram, in addition to
                    revamping the AINET website as a forum for exchange, dissemination and interaction.

            <h4>Future Plans of the Project</h4><br>
            <p align=" justify">
                    Within the larger team of the AINET Connect Associates, we are consolidating smaller groups or
                    pairs of teachers that will hold responsibility of looking after different social media platforms, which
                    they will manage for longer durations. The two face-to-face meetings-cum-workshops spread
                    through the year were crucial in capacity building of the AINET Connect Associates. This is expected
                    to further strengthen the reach and impact of AINET, enhance its organisational capabilities and
                    benefit its membership (and wider ELT community) in terms of professional development. Efforts
                    are underway to expand these teams with the addition of new volunteers. This is in order to build a
                    potential second line of leadership, besides ensuring a wider participatory management of AINET
                    activities and building on the expertise available within AINET. It is also proposed to prepare a draft
                    social media policy, as well as a manual/ handbook on social media management, for teacher
                    associations based on the experience and learnings of the project, which will be highly useful guiding
                    documents not only for AINET but also for other teacher associations.
