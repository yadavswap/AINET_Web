                    <h2>AINET Teacher Research Project 2015-16 (supported by IATEFL ReSIG)

                    </h2><br>
                    <p align=" justify">
                            AINET (All India Network of English Teachers) conducted a voluntary Teacher Research Project in India, wherein teachers took up small action research studies on issues/ concerns of their choice, with AINET supporting them at every stage of research. The project culminated in the presentation of these studies at the 3rd AINET International Conference in Nagpur on 8-9 January 2016. The reserach studies were later brought out as the publication- Exploring Learners and Learning of English. This book is an important outcome of the project and has scores of ‘locally-rooted’ studies exploring various aspects of teaching-learning English in a range of contexts. But another, even more important outcome is the participating teachers’ professional development through engagement with research. The project aimed to help teachers become researchers and build their capacity for reflection and theorizing.
